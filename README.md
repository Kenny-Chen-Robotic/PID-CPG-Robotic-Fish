# Autonomous Robotic Fish
This repository is about the algorithm framework of a wire-driven robotic fish, which contains basic CPG module coded with C++ (implementing in STM32 micro-controller) and orientation module coded with python (impplementing in Raspberry Pi 4B). The algorithm is robust and is applied for experiment testing in real world directly. Moreover, this desperate design offers a convenient hardware platform for validating other AI agent algorithm by substituting PID algorithm. 
Having fun with robotic :)
